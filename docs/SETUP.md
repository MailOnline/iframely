# Deploy Iframely Gateway to Your Own Servers

For rapid development, you can implement against community endpoint on [iframely.com](https://iframely.com). Deploy to your own hardware, when it's time to take it live.

## Stay Secure - Host on Dedicated Domain

It is highly recommended that you install [Iframely Open-Source](https://iframely.com/get) on a dedicated domain. 

There are few cases, when rendering of embed content is required by the server, for example the articles. Even though Iframely tries to detect and eliminate any insecure code of 3rd parties, for cross-domain security of your application, it will be wiser to keep render endpoints under different domain and allow your main domain in CORS settings (see config options below).



## Initial Installation

Node.js version 0.8 and higher is required (was tested up to 0.10). Install it from [pre-built installer](http://nodejs.org/download/) for your platform or from any of the [package managers](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

    cd <your servers dir>
    git clone https://github.com/itteco/iframely.git
    cd iframely
    npm install

It will also install all the package dependencies.

If you're using Mac OS, you might need to install [ImageMagic CLI](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#macosx) tools to make image size detection work. 


## Configure Iframely

Please, create your local config file to adjust settings. This local config file will be ignored when you pull new versions from Git later on.

    cp config.local.js.SAMPLE config.local.js
    vi config.local.js

Edit the sample config file as you need. You may also override any values from main config.js in your local config.

At the very least, you need to properly configure:

- `baseAppUrl` - the domain you host Iframely Gateway on. This is required for some embeds that need custom renders.
- `CACHE_ENGINE` - the caching middleware you'd prefer to use (No Cache, Redis, Memcached or Node.js in-memory cache)
- If you chose Redis or Memcached, you need to connect Iframely gateway with these systems
- `allowedOrigins` - very important to list your main app's domain(s) here, and block access to others 

The important piece to configure is `WHITELIST_WILDCARD`. This record indicates the default behavior of the the gateway with regards to various embeds protocols and types. For example, you can allow or deny Open Graph videos, any oEmbed types or Twitter Players. If you leave this record empty or omit it alltogether, no additional rich parsers will be enabled, leaving domain providers,meta and thumbnails ones only. See the [record format description](https://iframely.com/qa/format).

There are also some provider-specific values you might want to configure (e.g. wheather to include media in Twitter status embeds). Please, enter your own application keys and secret tokens where applicable.

You can also fine-tune API response time by disabling image size detection or readability parser. 



## Run Server

Starting the server is simple. From Iframely home directory:

    node server

To run server in cluster mode, use

    node cluster


We highly recommend using [Forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) though. It makes stopping and restarting of the servers so much easier:

    npm install -g forever
    forever start -l iframely.log server.js



## Add Required Locations to Your Reverse Proxy

Depending on your setup, you may need to configure these pathes in your reverse proxy settings to point to Iframely's Node.js instance:

    /r/.+               -- static files (including iframely.js client library)
    /iframely           -- main API endpoint with get params - returns oEmbed/2 as JSON
    /oembed             -- wrapper around main API. Returns oEmbed v1 JSON and other meta
    /debug              -- optional debugger UI with get params
    /reader.js          -- API endpoint with get params - proxies script to render article
    /render             -- API endpoint with get params - prexies custom widgets if required
    /meta-mappings      -- optional API endpoint with available unified meta
    /supported-plugins-re.json - the list of regexps for plugins



## Update Iframely

Please, update Iframely Gateway as we keep adding features or releasing fixes. 

The domain plugins are error-prone due to dependencies to 3rd parties. Domain plugins do break from time to time, and we'll release hot fixes in this case. Please, follow [Iframely on Twitter](http://twitter.com/iframely) to get timely heads up when hot fixes are required.


To update Iframely package to its latest version run from Iframely home directory:

    git pull
    
and restart your server afterwards. If you use [Forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever), run for example:

    forever restartall



## Extend functionality with Domains DB

You can greatly extend gateway functionality without writting additional plugins. Just upload Domains DB JSON file into `whitelist` folder and Iframely will start covering extra domains, generating responsive players, twitter photos, etc via generic plugins.

The file name is expected to be of "iframely-*.json" pattern. Lastest filename uploaded to this directory prevails. 

You can get whitelist file with over 1600 domains at [iframely.com/qa/buy](https://iframely.com/qa/buy). Setting `WHITELIST_URL` in config file to your personal access URL will instruct Iframely to load domains DB from the server periodically. If neither local file nor `WHITELIST_URL` are provided, Iframely will use a free file with top 100 domains from [iframely.com/qa/top100.json](http://iframely.com/qa/top100.json). 

If you wish to create your own whitelist, please, follow [required file format](http://iframely.com/qa/format).
