# Iframely API for Responsive Web Embeds

Iframely is fast and simple HTTP API for responsive web embeds. It also can be used as Node.js library. 

HTTP API are available as [oEmbed](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) or [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) formats. Iframely formats basically mimics the `<head>` section of the page with its `meta` and `links` elements.

In response to `url` request, APIs returns you the embeds and meta for a requested web page. Below are samples from [hosted API](https://iframely.com), just to show you the format:

- [>> Hereâ€™s API call for Coub video](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.json)
- [>> Same one, but as oEmbed](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.oembed)

Iframely does it by parsing [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) and general meta on the original page. Or by using specific domain plugins in the package. 

There are over 150 custom domains included as open-source. Plus, there is a whitelist option for oEmbed, Open Graph and Twitter Cards that acts like a gigantic plugin for generic parsers. You can [create your own whitelist](https://iframely.com/docs/whitelist-format) or [get one](https://iframely.com/plans) with [over 1600 domains](https://iframely.com/try) from Iframely. By default, our whitelist with Top 100 domains is included for free with your package.
